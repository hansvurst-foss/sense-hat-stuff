These are some little Python sripts created for the awesome Sense HAT. Just a personal collection of self-written examples and funny bits. 

Feel free to fork and and have fun!

There are a few dependencies right now you have to fix yourself before trying to run the project.
For the moment please have a look at all imported modules in the code.
